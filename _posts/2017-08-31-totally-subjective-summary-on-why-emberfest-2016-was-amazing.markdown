# Totally subjective summary on why EmberFest'16 was amazing - and why EmberFest'17 will be

When I learned that EmberFest'16 was to be held in my hometown, Budapest, I
could barely contain my excitement. I attended all previous EmberFests in other
beautiful cities across Europe, but the idea that for once I didn't have to go to
EmberFest because EmberFest came to me was almost too much to take.

And, although the bar was reeeally high, the conference didn't disappoint the
least.

### Pre-conference meetup

We, the organizers of the Ember.js Budapest meetup group
([Ember.BP][ember.bp]), decided to do a pre-conference get together the evening
before the conference. It turned out extremely well, with a record-high
attendance for our small group (~40 people were sitting into a small room) and
great talks.

After the talks, we moved headquarters to Budapest's bar district to have a
post-meetup, pre-conference drinks and continue chatting.

The evening had a great vibe, with Ember friends flying here from all over the
world (some of them seeing the illuminated city, which is quite the sight, for
the first time), and I was ever so excited for being able to "host" them here.

### The conference

The conference had the same structure as in previous years. One track, two-day,
with an opening keynote and 45-minute presentations including Q&A. The chats in
the lobby between talks were great and the whole vibe was very laid back and
familiar, although I might be biased as I still couldn't believe my Ember peeps
came to me this time (the feeling only went away when the conference was over).

### Dinner on a boat

EmberFest also has the venerable tradition of having a dinner in the evening of
the second day, after the conference is over. That's a tradition I really
cherish and last year's occasion was really a special one.

The dinner took place on a boat that cruised along the Danube, with the
illuminated city as backdrop - not too shabby! It was hard to say goodbye to
friends, old and new, once the ship returned to its port, so we didn't yet. We
went back to Budapest's bar district and postponed the moment we had to part
ways by a few hours.

As Joachim, who almost single-handedly organized the previous 3 EmberFest
conferences, announced his resigation from this position at the end of the
talks, new plans started to slowly form...

### EmberFest not dead

A few of us, European Ember lovers, met again at EmberConf'17 in Portland, and
started to talk about the possibility of continuing EmberFest.

We formed a group later in the spring, involving Joachim and a few others and
our small but very enthusiastic team started to get things rolling.

Berlin, having a [renascent Ember.js meetup group][ember-berlin] and great
direct connections to lots of cities, came out on top and soon after we've
found and nailed down [the gorgeous venue][villa] for the event.

About two more months passed and by now, an amazing roster of people have
confirmed they're speaking at EmberFest, and we're in the process of selecting
talks for the remaining slots.

The conference is again going to be a 1-track, 2-day one and is happening on
the 27th and 28th of October.

We'd like to continue the tradition of the EmberFest dinner but we wanted to
first and foremost ensure the conference is happening. If your company would be
willing to sponsor the dinner and help carrying on the tradition ~~to the next
generation~~ this year, please [get in contact with us][mail].
