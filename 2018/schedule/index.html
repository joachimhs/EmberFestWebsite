          Ember does not have the best reputation for being suited for mobile apps, mostly for being "too large". But
          why does size matter, and how can we keep it small? Future techniques like tree-shaking and code-splitting
          will support this task. But there are quite a few things you can do today to reduce your bundle size. </p>
        <p>
          Based on the experience of optimizing my own app, this talk will guide you through the iterative process of
          measuring, analyzing and optimizing your app's size. For each of these phases I will introduce you to some
          essential tools and helpful practical tips.

          vim or emacs, text editor or IDE, no matter what you use to write your Ember applications you will likely use
          some form of editor integration. Some only provide code highlighting, others provide integrated linting and
          sophisticated code navigation. In this talk we will take a look at the Ember Language Server powering the
          Visual Studio Code plugin. We will talk about the features it provides and how they are implemented, and

          improve the perceived performance, and how to deploy an app to multiple platforms & app stores. </p>

          HTML forms can represent a time before JavaScript was an integral part of application development. Creating

          to do, what not to do, which Ember addons have come to the rescue, and how to make forms accessible.

          As Ember developers, a large percentage of us work on data-intensive applications. Ember Data and JSON:API
          give us really powerful tools for interacting with our data. Sometimes these tools still aren’t flexible
          enough and we end up implementing our own data model witchery/wizardry. In this talk we’ll explore why, and

          The templating layer in Ember has evolved architecturally numerous times in the history of the project. At
          each stage of this evolution we have been able to increase performance and ergonomics without introducing a
          lot of instability. But what's next for templating in Ember? In this talk I will explore the advantages of
          the VM architecture and why I think Ember is leading the way for a re-examination of how the larger JS
          community thinks about rendering.

          We now have the tools to build apps that run fast (and that's only getting better as Glimmer advances) but
          they can only do so after having been delivered to our users. This talk explores what tools and mechanisms
          are available to get our apps to our users' devices faster, reducing the time until first and repeat
          launches.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will look into mechanisms like HTTP/2, resource hints and lazy loading. We will also look at tooling that
          gives us better insight into the performance consequences each merged PR. Finally, we'll explore mechanisms
          in the Ember ecosystem to further optimize app delivery.
