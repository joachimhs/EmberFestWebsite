    of
    enterprise applications. His consultancy, Polynomial LLC, leads ambitious software projects for a
    diverse
    group of businesses and nonprofits. He was a research associate of the MIT Media Lab’s Social
    Computing
    group, and was a lead engineer at Akamai Technologies, where he built critical, internet-scale
    security

  talk: Performance culture. New opportunities with Embroider

    Performance culture is a unique culture that is not often seen among companies. Only the ones that
    care
    enough
    and invest time in it can see the benefits. Up until Embroider was released, the Ember community, even
    if
    wanted to embrace performance culture, wasn't able to actually iterate on the results.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my talk, I'll go through the goals we've set and how we accomplished some great results by using
    Embroider
    and Webpack. Our journey is not finished but I already have a bunch of tricks and prescriptions for
    you.
    I'll
    show what are the tools we use to make sure we keep the quality high.

  description: <p>
    Having Ember historically so closely modelled to Ruby on Rails, it is easy to also apply the same approach
    in
    writing tests for both. What has been shown in the last 10 or so years is that backends are fundamentally
    different from frontends. This fundamental difference also requires a fundamentally different approach to
    thinking about and writing tests. This shift in thinking can be difficult or underestimated by developers
    who
    come from a Rails/backend background, which is the case for plenty of Ember developers. The result is a vast
    and
    diverse pool of tests written using different patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
    At Intercom we have done testing with and without thinking about the user first. Inevitably a code base
    being
    worked on by many engineers brings many different patterns together. This results in a highly diverse test
    suite
    that a lot can be learned from. Taking stock of whatever is present and seeing how we can improve upon what
    exists following a set of guiding principles makes Intercom an org with ever improving code quality. This
    talk
    will bring some real world examples of patterns (good and bad) that live within the Intercom codebase today.
    We
    will (potentially) go over some refactoring of these real world examples to solidify the learnings and
    principles outlined in the talk. With anecdotal evidence it becomes easier to see the power and value of
    user
    centric testing.
    </p>
  bio: <p>
    Currently a Product Engineer at Intercom, naturally very curious with a drive to understand how
    great
    products
    are made from the ground up. On a continuous journey to thoroughly grasp the full stack of product
    development, from frontend to DevOps to shipping at scale to a hint of design. Beyond technical
    stuff he
    loves
    traveling across the globe and learning the different cuisines of countries he travels to (oh and
    coffee
    is
    great).

  talk: Mock & Roll

  description: "<p>
    Testing is usually the Achilles Heel of most teams, where knowledge is lacking and practice doesn’t
    necessarily translate in good standard guidelines. Throw mock into the mix, and the picture gets ever
    fuzzier. What to mock? What not to mock? Wait, what’s the difference between a mock and a stub??
    This talk will give the audience a practical mental framework of when to use each class of fake
    objects and methods we have at our disposal, with the specific flavour of Sinon.js.

  bio: "<p>
    Gonçalo is a Portuguese computer engineer turned front-end developer, currently living in London.
    Recurse Center alumnus, digital nomad wannabe, jack of all trades because there are too many
    interesting things. Relatively new to Ember, he’s happy to have joined such a friendly community! He
    grows a beard most of the time.

  talk: "A framework for ambitious companies"

    When we started building Qonto, we knew that the default path of piling up features would lead to a
    codebase
    where it's hard to implement changes and easy to create bugs. That's why we adopted Ember.js. The
    framework
    provided us with stable foundations and consistent practices, making it technically easy for our team
    of 50
    engineers to build new features or make improvements in any domain of our apps.
    </p>
    <p>
    Similarly, we know that the default path of growing a company by specializing teams leads to Big
    Company
    Disease. Attempts to create economies of scale cut the connection with customers. Focus shifts to
    defining
    scopes, setting up procedures, and standardizing work. Agile withers to solidified processes and
    tools, with
    little care given to individuals and interactions. Team mood suffers.
    </p>
    <p>
    What if we had a framework?
    </p>
  bio: <p>
    I'm CTO at Qonto, the leading European business finance solution. I was a Django core developer for
    a
    decade,
    contributing to most components of the framework and also to the governance of the project. These
    days I'm
    focusing my open-source efforts on the websockets Python package. I spend most of my life keeping
    things
    as
    simple as they can be and making it easy for engineers to build good code.
