  talk: Building a phygital platform with Ember.js

  description: <p>Have you ever been to a museum where you used an app or touchscreen to deep dive into a subject? At Ocular, we build phygital applications for museums and showrooms, all with Ember.js. This talk will cover how we started with Ember.js, and how we went from physical installations to virtual showrooms.</p>

  talk: "{{should-avoid this.renderModifiers butHow=true}}"
  id: aaron-chambers
  image_extension: "jpeg"
  description: "<p>
    The ember-render-modifiers README states that the modifiers are “very useful for quickly bridging the
    gap between classic components and Glimmer components, but they are still generally an anti-pattern.”
    It also says that you should “rethink your functionality rather than use these modifiers as a
    crutch.”.
    </p>
    <p>
    However, the README doesn’t give any real guidance on what we should do instead.
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk I’m explain why these modifiers are problematic and explore the two main use cases I’ve
    seen ember-render-modifiers used for and how we can go about replacing them with modern Ember patterns
    that will set us up for success in the future. And finally, after this talk, we’ll have a resource to
    which we can point future engineers when they scratch their heads about how to avoid these modifiers.

  talk: Two Ember Apps Become One
  id: mo-fiebiger
  image_extension: "jpeg"
  description: "<p>
    Have you ever imagined how you would be challenged to embed one Ember app inside another? Well, if you
    have, then you’re in luck and if you haven’t, buckle up, because it’s gonna be a weird 30 minutes!
    </p>
    <p>
    Just like every developer, here at Phorest, we are all dealing with the impact of legacy code. In turn
    this can lead to difficult decisions, but even more creative solutions. While migrating our entire
    system to a browser only product, we found a solution to embed our older Ember application into our
    current Ember application via… you guessed it… an iframe.
    </p>
    <p>
    With the tale of two apps becoming one, we can deliver a browser product to our users faster than
    ever. Alongside this, we will discuss the technical decisions made from rooting between the two
    applications all the way to standardising styles. What seemed impossible in the beginning now is a
    seamless experience of one magical Ember application inside another.
    </p>"
  bio: "<p>
    Mo is a Software Engineer at Phorest Salon Software and her background is in visual arts and
    psychology. Before she started her masters in computer science, she had never written a single line
    of code. This was a challenge, but looking back, Mo feels taking the leap of faith was the best
    thing she has ever done. Now, Mo’s passion is being an advocate for diversity in tech and teaching
    others to grow their technical skills as a Co-host on Fizz Buzz Podcast.

  talk: Bootstrap your dashboard the right way
  id: alexis-falaise

  description: "<p>
    Drawing on the web has never been straightforward, and multiple standards have been emerging to adress
    that complexity. Whether you decide to opt for the versatility of HTML canvas, or keep closer to the
    scalability and resilience of SVGs, choosing the right library to fulfill all product requirements can
    be dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
    What are the critical questions to address when building a dashboard? How to keep accessibility in
    mind? And first of all, which library should you go for when working with Ember?
    </p>"
  bio: "<p>
    Hi ! I'm Alexis. I've been passionated with crafting intuitive interfaces for quite some time, and
    I'm now taking that passion to another level working at Qonto. I spend most of my time listening to
    (or making) music when not working on lines of code - when I can't do both 😄.

  talk: Automated Visual Testing in Ember
  id: ignace-maes

  description: "<p>
    Ember gives developers the power to write tests and be confident about deployments. But have you ever
    made a change that broke your application layout while still passing all tests?
    </p>
    <p>
    In this talk we’ll explore the world of visual testing to keep your app pixel perfect and have that
    peace of mind when deploying. By the end, you should be able to understand how visual testing works
    and how to set it up in a reliable way, even for applications with complex data structures and time
    dependent logic.

    with Ember for 4 years and counting.
