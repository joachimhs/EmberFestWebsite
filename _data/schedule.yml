        <p>After a brief introduction to what v2 addons are, how they are different from v1 addons, and how to create one, this talk will focus on the more advanced use cases. Especially those that require unlearning what v1 addons do, and which require a totally different approach instead:</p>
        <ul><li>How to ship components with their own CSS</li><li>How to provide static assets to the consuming app, either by the classic way of „pushing“ into /public, or by „pulling“ through an import</li><li>Ways to make your addon configurable</li><li>How to provide built-time integrations without broccoli, but by providing your own webpack loaders. And how to make those configurable also</li><li>How to make the build-time integrations work universally with either webpack or Vite</li></ul>

In the process, we will walk through the challenges I have encountered while designing, building, and ultimately publishing an addon of my own.</p><p>In the end of the talk, you will be equipped to build your own addons and know the various pitfalls to watch for.</p>

        <p>Ember meets art and AI in ‘From El Jardín to Ember: The Aittendee Experience’.</p><p>Our presentation starts with a deep-dive into the renowned “El Jardín de las Delicias” from the Prado Museum in Madrid. This intricate masterpiece serves as our live test subject, aiding in showcasing ‘Aittendee’, an Ember app that’s listening right along with you.</p><p>But ‘Aittendee’ is more than just a passive listener. Its AI-powered functionalities include real-time transcription, summarizing, extracting key definitions, and generating compelling pull quotes. The app interprets and visually illustrates central concepts of the presentation. It keeps the talk on track by providing feedback on pace and sentiment, and it even creates tailored questions from virtual audience members.</p><p>But this isn’t magic—it’s Ember. The second segment of our talk will pull back the curtain on ‘Aittendee’s’ inner workings. We delve into Ember’s role, the app’s features and architecture, and the AI APIs that allow such real-time, high-level processing. From detailed code snippets to architectural strategies, we’ll walk through the technical elements that enable this seamless, immersive experience.</p><p>Join us on this journey of revelation and innovation, an intersection of art and technology. Whether you’re drawn to the allure of “El Jardín de las Delicias” or just want the technical how-to, you’ll leave with an appreciation for both.</p>

      description: >
        <p>When given the same set of inputs, we expect our code to produce the same outputs each time. To use the technical term: we expect our code to be deterministic. When our test suite starts to show signs of flakiness, it usually means that a source of non-determinism has creeped into our code. Perhaps our code is influenced by some global state, which we hadn’t previously considered as ‘an input’. Or perhaps there’s a timing issue which introduces a source of randomness to the outcome of a test.</p><p>We’ll study examples that demonstrate how a test can pass in some circumstances and fail in others. The examples will be very much within the Ember ecosystem, using Qunit and testem, so it will be easily relatable for the EmberFest audience. Having learned to spot the problems that can cause a flaky test, we’ll develop some strategies to defend against allowing these issues to make their way into production.</p>

        <p>I plan to organize my talk around an existing, big Ember project and show gradually how we can improve the CI pipeline. I will start with an unoptimized pipeline and step by step get to a pretty cool setup. I think the listeners will be able to find their situation on one of the slides. I guess that some people will start learning new things from the beginning whereas some (more advanced folks) will find useful information in the next slides. I’m sure everyone will find something exciting that they can start doing in their companies when they are back from the conference.</p><p>Most of the talk will be organized around speed - how to make things faster - build faster, test faster, and deliver faster. But I also plan to show how to get more insights from their pipeline. Mostly from tests. CI runs frequently and it’s a missed opportunity to not learn something from these runs.</p>

We will cover topics such as: - Introduction to template tag components, including syntax and strict mode. - Examples of template-only components, and components with local variables and fuctions (class-less components) - Examples of importing framework-provided and addon-provided template helpers and modifiers - Component composition patterns - Local components - Dynamic components - Using tracked built-in classes in components - Patterns for <code>Array</code> and <code>Map</code> - Using Resources - Examples with <code>cell</code>, <code>use</code> - Working with data fetching - What and how you can use today in your applications and addons</p>

      description: >
        <p>Translating the Ember Guides to French? English is accepted as the common language developers use to share their work, so what’s the point? Is a translation really worth it? I’ll tell you a bit about this in this talk. To sum it up: there’s a huge difference between being able to set a few variable names in English in a codebase and understanding advanced topics covered by the documentation. I consider language as part of the accessibility, and I strongly believe the Ember Guides deserve to be as accessible as possible because they’re not only about learning Ember, they’re about getting what you’re doing to become a better developer.</p><p>In the main part of the talk, we will learn how the Ember Guides are built and what are the challenges to customize a fork to create this kind of translated website. We will explore three technical aspects: a bit of Ember magic to customize the UI, a series of amazing spell-checking tools maintained by unifiedjs collective, and a bunch of git commands to follow the official Ember Guides updates. Along the way, I’ll mention an addon with the barbaric name of “guidemaker-ember-locale-template”, which aims at being flexible enough to help with any translation project for the Ember Guides. So who knows, maybe this talk could be inspiring?</p>

        <p>Having individuals consistently work on Frontend Infrastructure can supercharge your organization by creating a separation of concerns between infra and product, making your product engineers more productive and helping your organization keep up to date with modern advancements in technology.</p>   <p>When codebases are small it’s easier for product engineers to make updates improving frontend infrastructure alongside their regular product work. Unfortunately, when codebases and teams scale, this becomes harder to do well. Large codebases become harder to maintain over time, resulting in longer timeframes to make sweeping improvements or adopt new standards. This makes it untenable to rely solely on product engineers to make sporadic improvements due to conflicting priorities with their team.</p><p>But how should this team operate? How should it decide what to work on? How should it measure success? I’ll be discussing our journey to adopt such a team. We’ll cover how we think about our roadmap, how we prioritise work and how we measure and define success.</p>
