          Ember has been around for a while. It has survived several JavaScript framework eras by delivering innovation without leaving users behind. In this presentation I will be looking into the recent work that will unlock the next stage of Ember, and share my personal vision of what that next stage might look like.

        steadily reducing the cost of shipping sophisticated applications. By
        making it easier to compose applications out of high-level, shared

However, frontend developers are often the last team that has impact on final product and that is why I believe that improving the UX is their job. Despite the fact how missing the designs or backend are, frontend should address all these issues and provide best possible quality. I will explain what are key UX topics to address by frontend (being fast, feeling native, indicate current state and handle errors) and how Ember and its ecosystem can help achieve these.</p>

          Having a strong data layer, Ember is well suited for the task of
          data entry, it allows for easily building data encoding tools, complex
          forms with foreign key drop-downs, several levels of nested records,
          translations and more. But building such a tool still requires lots of
          boilerplate work mainly synchronizing information like API definition
          and "possible actions" between backend and frontend. But it doesn't
          have to be that way!

        <p>For many, the first hybrid experience is one of poor performance and frustrating code management. Common techniques such as 'keep a shallow dom' and 'watch reflow' feel reasonable but hard to achieve, and even harder to contextualize in Ember.</p>
        <p>We will first cover the basics of hybrid apps before building a basic hybrid Ember app with ember-cordova, and will then focus on issues such as application structure, graceful mobile web fallbacks, animation optimization &amp; handling native integrations such as push.</p>

        <p>Ember offers a rich API and a wide set of helpers and blueprints to make testing in your apps fast and straight-forward. But as the applications we write tests against grow more complex, we might find ourselves stumbling into test timeouts, eventually succeeding tests and other hard-to-reason about test errors brought on by asynchronous and time-dependent behaviour.</p>
        <p>This talk will give an insight into how to create meaningful test cases for async or other, time-related operations in our applications.  We will see how we can leverage Ember's test helpers, newest JavaScript features and Ember community addons to reduce non-determinism in our test suites and make those tests turn green even as time passes by.</p>
