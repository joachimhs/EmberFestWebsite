      Obviously this year’s event is going to be special with the pandemic still not being over. In order to comply with italian laws as well as to ensure every on-site attendee's safety, there are some rules and safety measures to be aware of:
    </p>
    <ul class="content-text">
      <li>Attendees will need to be either fully vaccinated, recovered, or tested (PCR test, no older than 72h or Antigen test, no older than 48h) and be able to prove that via the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/live-work-travel-eu/coronavirus-response/safe-covid-19-vaccines-europeans/eu-digital-covid-certificate" class="content-link">EU’s Digital COVID Certificate</a>. We will take photos of all attendees’ certificate barcodes when entering the venue on both days.</li>
      <li>Everyone will need to wear masks indoors at all times.</li>
      <li>Seating will be set up so that a minimal distance is kept between attendees.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="content-text text-align">
      The venue does have a large outdoor area as well in which we all will be able to gather during the breaks, before and after the talks.
    </p>
