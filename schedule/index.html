          Ember does not have the best reputation for being suited for mobile apps, mostly for being "too large". But why does size matter, and how can we keep it small? Future techniques like tree-shaking and code-splitting will support this task. But there are quite a few things you can do today to reduce your bundle size.        </p>
        <p>
          Based on the experience of optimizing my own app, this talk will guide you through the iterative process of measuring, analyzing and optimizing your app's size. For each of these phases I will introduce you to some essential tools and helpful practical tips.

          vim or emacs, text editor or IDE, no matter what you use to write your Ember applications you will likely use some form of editor integration. Some only provide code highlighting, others provide integrated linting and sophisticated code navigation. In this talk we will take a look at the Ember Language Server powering the Visual Studio Code plugin. We will talk about the features it provides and how they are implemented, and discuss what else is planned for the future.

Creating forms isn’t always the most exciting part of development and, at times, it may seem daunting. Fear not! I’d like to talk through some pain points of building an important piece of user interface: we will discuss what to do, what not to do, which Ember addons have come to the rescue, and how to make forms accessible.

          For EmberConf, we built a cutting-edge Ember mobile web app to serve as a convenient up-to-the-minute reference for the conference's schedule. Now updated for EmberFest, I'll highlight how we made this conference schedule app a fully compliant Progressive Web App. We'll walk through the steps needed to take your mobile Ember app out of the mobile browser and onto your users' home screens. With new native platform support available just this year and the backing of the always-amazing Ember addon ecosystem, making your Ember app fully PWA capable has never been easier or more worthwhile.

Sometimes these tools still aren’t flexible enough and we end up implementing our own data model witchery/wizardry.

However, frontend developers are often the last team that has impact on final product and that is why I believe that improving the UX is their job. Despite the fact how missing the designs or backend are, frontend should address all these issues and provide best possible quality. I will explain what are key UX topics to address by frontend (being fast, feeling native, indicate current state and handle errors) and how Ember and its ecosystem can help achieve these.</p>

At each stage of this evolution we have been able to increase performance and ergonomics without introducing a lot of instability. But what's next for templating in Ember?
