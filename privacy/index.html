      <p>Emberfest uses Google Analytics to collect user statistics.</p>
      <p>Google Analytics is a service that collects data about website visitors.</p>
      <h4>What Google Analytics records</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>The referrer that let a user to this website</li>
        <li>The duration of the visit</li>
        <li>Information about the client used to access the website</li>
        <li>other information</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>How we use that data</h4>
      <p>The information recorded by Google Analytics allows us to better understand the audience of this website, what
        content theyâ€™re accessing and how they get here. This allows us to make better decisions about design, writing
        and marketing.</p>
      <p>No personally identifying data is ever included in the reports that we run.</p>
      <p>For further information please refer to the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google
          Analytics Terms of Service</a>.</p>
      <p>Google offers a <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">browser plugin</a> to opt out of the
        Google Analytics tracking service.</p>
