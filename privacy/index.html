    <p>Emberfest uses Google Analytics to collect user statistics.</p>
    <p>Google Analytics is a service that collects data about website visitors.</p>
    <h3>What Google Analytics records</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The referrer that let a user to this website</li>
      <li>The duration of the visit</li>
      <li>Information about the client used to access the website</li>
      <li>other information</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How we use that data</h3>
    <p>
      The information recorded by Google Analytics allows us to better understand the audience of this website, what
      content theyâ€™re accessing and how they get here. This allows us to make better decisions about design, writing
      and marketing.</p>
    <p>No personally identifying data is ever included in the reports that we run.</p>
    <p>For further information please refer to the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google
        Analytics Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    <p>Google offers a <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">browser plugin</a> to opt out of the
      Google Analytics tracking service.</p>
