    <p>Emberfest uses Google Analytics to collect user statistics.</p>
    <p>Google Analytics is a service that collects data about website visitors.</p>
    <h3>What Google Analytics records</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The referrer that let a user to this website</li>
      <li>The duration of the visit</li>
      <li>Information about the client used to access the website</li>
      <li>other information</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How we use that data</h3>
    <p>
      The information recorded by Google Analytics allows us to better understand the audience of this website, what
      content they’re accessing and how they get here. This allows us to make better decisions about design, writing
      and marketing.</p>
    <p>No personally identifying data is ever included in the reports that we run.</p>
    <p>For further information please refer to the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html">Google
        Analytics Terms of Service</a>.</p>
    <p>Google offers a <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">browser plugin</a> to opt out of the
      Google Analytics tracking service.</p>
