          For some time now we’ve designed our apps to be responsive based on media queries. Our applications have evolved and used abstractions around the global media context with tools like <code>ember-responsive</code> which have gotten us pretty far. But in a world of components the context isn’t global, it’s local. Let me show you how we can build components that are responsive to their immediate environment and work anywhere.

          How do polyglots learn natural languages so quickly and easily? Do we follow a similar process when learning programming languages? We will dive into the key differences and similarities of learning natural versus programming languages and consider how we can apply the most effective methods of learning natural languages to improving the processes by which we learn to code.</p>

          Ever wondered where your component state went or where it came from? ​​In this talk you will learn how arguments, decorators and tracked properties make state management of your component built in Ember Octane easier than ever before. In comparison with patterns known from traditional Ember apps, you will learn how to transform your modern components to predictable and future-proof building blocks of your application.

          Many key Ember.js components are written in TypeScript, and for good reason. Strongly typed code is a winner: type safety makes it often run correctly on first try, and harder to introduce bugs when modifying it. This matters especially in large, complex codebases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should you start writing your Ember.js apps in TypeScript, too? How to do it? Is it practical and actually "worth it"? This talk attempts to answer these questions, based on real-life experience of introducing TypeScript into existing production application.

          We’re all human, and even a software developer will make mistakes, introduce bugs or leave code we (or others) regret later. How can we make the most of our Ember app and how can we face the issues we are creating? While Ember is growing and developers are using it for even more advanced software, handling errors and debugging will become more advanced too. With this talk we work through pain points, analysing, debugging, what to do and what not to do on solving problems and reducing them.

          Compilers have a reputation for being esoteric and intimidating. But they don't need to be! A compiler is just a program that writes programs. This talk will be a practical tour through the Embroider build system that also teaches compiler concepts along the way.

          With the power of multi-pass compilation, Embroider can take a long-lived, conventional Ember app and give it lazy loading, code splitting, and tree shaking. All without modifying the app's own code.

          We often talk about the well-lit path, but what about the danger that lurks in the shadows? What happens when you make one poor choice? What happens when you make 10 poor choices? 100? Sometimes, we just make a mistake. Other times, we believe that the “shortcut” is the answer. Our apps don’t become a mess in a day- and it will take longer than a day to clean them up. There is no silver bullet that will fix everything. We’ll discuss some of those choices, their consequences, and practical steps we can take to allow our apps (and ourselves) the room to become better versions of themselves.

          The Millennium Falcon Lego set has 7,541 pieces and takes 35 hours to build. Imagine how much time could be saved if a fraction of those pieces were replaced with Duplos. In this talk I will share how my team has successfully extracted large sections of our apps into reusable “Duplos”. These Ember Duplos are used to rapidly start apps not just at the 10th floor but the 50th. We will explore how Ember enables us to build, compose, and customize these large logical addons. In addition, I will propose how our community might benefit from a Duplo ecosystem as it has with addons.

          Live video provides our members an interactive engaging format since other members are actively commenting and reacting on the video in real time. However, when viewing a live video afterwards as a replay, we still want to preserve this user experience since most comments and reactions make more sense with the point in time context of the video. We will go through the entire lifecycle of a member action and what role Ember plays within it – from being created while watching a live video – to being requested and displayed during live and much later on when the live video gets replayed.

          Change is in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          Octane! Tracked Properties! Native Classes! Angle Bracket Syntax! Element Modifiers! So much has changed in Ember over the past 12 months, but what about EmberData?
        </p>
        <p>
          It might not seem it just yet, but the EmberData you are using today is a vastly more powerful and more flexible library than the EmberData the community has grown up with.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we were busy shedding weight and preparing for tree-shaking, we were also busy designing an improved core experience that builds upon the strongest aspects of the library.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Future of Data is now.

          Chris ("real name" @runspired) is an engineer at LinkedIn and a member of the Ember Data Core Team. When he isn't working on your data-layer or answering questions in discord, he can usually be found running ultra-long distances (just look for the fellow dashing up and down the biggest hill in view). He recently got married to a wife gracious enough to understand both these passions.
